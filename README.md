# Coding-Quiz
A timed coding quiz that is built off javascript.

On start button click the quiz begins. If a question is answered wrong time is subracted from the clock. At the end of the quiz you are informed how many you got correct and if you are in the top three, you will be asked for a name to put on the highscore chart that will be persistent until you clear your cache. If time runs out an alert will inform you your time is out and the game is over resetting the quiz to the start page.
